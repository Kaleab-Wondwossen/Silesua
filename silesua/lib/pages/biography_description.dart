Franchised and company-owned stores were planned to open in Austria, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the UK.[8] Bethlehem wanted to create well-paid jobs which could create prosperity using the artisan talents and natural resources of Ethiopia. The selection of footwear as the launch product for the company came later. Bethlehem was inspired by the seleate or barabasso, the traditional recycled tire sole shoe crafted in Ethiopia, and footwear became the locus around which she chose to build the company.[8]In 2016 the company sold 125,000 pairs of shoes and it had created 1,200 jobs.[3]Garden Of Coffee in 2017 In 2014, Bethlehem announced a new business venture, The Republic of Leather, via a blog post on the soleRebels website. Bethlehem identified the luxury leather goods industry as being \"ripe for a total re-imagining,\" along similar lines to what she had accomplished with soleRebels and the footwear industry. Besides espousing the same ideals of ecological and economic sustainability as soleRebels, The Republic of Leather is centered on principles of customer choiceâ€”customer choice of design, producer and receiving charity of 5% of the price they pay.[8] In 2017, Garden of Coffee was added to her companies. It begins with outlets in Addis Ababa."),
